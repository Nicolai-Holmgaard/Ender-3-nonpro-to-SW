# Ender-3-nonpro-to-SW
I wanted more speed and precision from my ender 3. And then i found the ender 3 -> switchwire conversion, and i was sold. But i have a nonpro ender 3, and most conversions were for the pro version. The files and information about the nonpro conversion were very spread out, so i just wated to make this to make it easier and have all files in one place.

## Authors
I haven't made any of these files, and thats why i have linked to the repositories and authors, and the download links are directly to the original repository.

## Mods
I have chosen to include some mods in here, they are:
 - keybak alternative (a cheap door closer from aliexpress)
 - Quickprobe
 - Filament runout sensor in clockwork 2



## Files to remove
When you download the whole repo from [boubounokefalos](https://github.com/boubounokefalos), there are some files that you need to remove because that get replaced by previously downloads. Files that needs to be deleted are:
 - rear_grill_middle.stl 
 - rear_extention_left_a.stl
 - PS_4040_Slide_Mount.stl
 - PS_4040_mount_x2.stl
 - rear_extention_left_a.stl
 - Whole DXF folder
 - y-axsis folder in gantry folder

I think thats it, i will double check later.

## Drilling y carrige
There is a drilling guide [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3530419/files). There are 2 diffent sets of holes that fit normal mgn12 and wide mgn12. Just drill the holes, and then it should fit. I will update this later.

## Documentation
If you need help with a bom or others, there is a great repository called [Enderwire_Docs](https://github.com/RobotRogue/Enderwire_Docs). There is a bom for screws and etc. There is a link to the original switchwire guide, that you can follow. The repository is a work in progress as of now, but there will be a full guide at some point.
